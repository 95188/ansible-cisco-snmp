## About

This repo contains [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) modules which use SNMP to change configuration on Cisco devices. The repo is currently in a proof of concept stage to see how you can manage older devices (which doesn't have a fancy api) with modern IT automation tools.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to provide idempotent modules for older Cisco devices.

## Alpha code

Currently this is only a test and there's a good chance that a lot of the code will change.

## Dependencies

This module requires:

* [pysnmp](http://pysnmp.sourceforge.net) 4.2.5 or later
* [nelsnmp](https://github.com/networklore/nelsnmp)
* A good old Cisco switch

## Installation of Ansible module
```
pip install nelsnmp
```
If you are running Ansible through a Python virtualenv you might need to change the ansible_python_interpreter variable. Check the hosts file in this repo for an example.

## Configuration of Cisco device

```
snmp-server community [write-community-string] rw [acl]
```

## Demo

Running the playbook the first time:

```
$ ansible-playbook -i hosts example-playbooks/how-to/examples-vlan.yml

PLAY [all] ********************************************************************

TASK: [Ensure VLAN 10 is present and has the name INTERNAL] *******************
changed: [172.29.50.5]

TASK: [Ensure VLAN 12 is present and has the name GUESTS] *********************
changed: [172.29.50.5]

TASK: [Ensure that VLAN 40 is created] ****************************************
ok: [172.29.50.5]

TASK: [Remove VLAN 80 if it is present] ***************************************
changed: [172.29.50.5]

PLAY RECAP ********************************************************************
172.29.50.5                : ok=4    changed=3    unreachable=0    failed=0
```

Running the playbook a second time:

```
$ ansible-playbook -i hosts example-playbooks/how-to/examples-vlan.yml

PLAY [all] ********************************************************************

TASK: [Ensure VLAN 10 is present and has the name INTERNAL] *******************
ok: [172.29.50.5]

TASK: [Ensure VLAN 12 is present and has the name GUESTS] *********************
ok: [172.29.50.5]

TASK: [Ensure that VLAN 40 is created] ****************************************
ok: [172.29.50.5]

TASK: [Remove VLAN 80 if it is present] ***************************************
ok: [172.29.50.5]

PLAY RECAP ********************************************************************
172.29.50.5                : ok=4    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0
```

## Todo

* Error handling (the module assumes that the SNMPv3 user/SNMPv2 community has write access to the device)
* Ability to save running configuration to startup configuration

## Known issues

* Naming conflicts: If you try to add a vlan using a name which already exists the module won't pick this up. The vlan will keep it's old name or be created without a name
* No checking if the provided vlan_id is a valid number. I.e. the module won't complain if you try to create a vlan with id 37812942

## Potential roadmap

* Change interfaces i.e. access/trunk port, vlan assignments, description, admin up/down
* Handle configuraion backups
* All other things which might be possible through SNMP
